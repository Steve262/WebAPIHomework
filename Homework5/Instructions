Steven Kosovich's Assignment 5 for Web API

There should be a JSON file with the Postman tests, showing the five different test commands desired in the requirements.

There should also be 2 CSV files showing the results of the analytics. I don't know if they are the correct analytics, but they are custom nonetheless. One of them shows how many times each movie was queried, and the other is a general thing.

The only way to see the reviews appended to the movies is by doing a /get on a specific movie, followed by a query saying reviews = true. An example is shown below.

If you want to test it manually, go to http://steve262-test.apigee.net/hw4/movies/ or http://steve262-test.apigee.net/hw4/movies/the avengers?reviews=true more specifically if you want a query parameter showing a movie and its reviews (change "the avengers" in there to another one of my movies to get their specific reviews).

You can also go to https://api.usergrid.com/steve262/sandbox/moviereviews/mr. bob to get a specific movie review by the reviewer's name from the BaaS. You can go to like https://api.usergrid.com/steve262/sandbox/movies/the avengers to go to the movie BaaS and search by movie, like The Avengers.

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!
