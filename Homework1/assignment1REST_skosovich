//Description: Analyzing data from a search of books with "Turing" in the title

RAW:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK	//This is the protocal used, so HTTP and version 1.1, and the 200 means it was good and went through
Expires: Thu, 05 Feb 2015 00:44:27 GMT		//When the session expires, which in this case is very soon
Date: Thu, 05 Feb 2015 00:44:27 GMT		//When the session was started
Cache-Control: private, max-age=0, must-revalidate, no-transform	//Security stuff, so cache-control is private, it can't get too old, you must revalidate the page to keep it working, and no-transform is a safety protocal for HTTP
ETag: "-roYZe-KGC8fMhY8_FAC-zdHGwU/eJrI3qh2rEAH1jRBzpO0pXQTAbM"	//The ETag is an HTTP protocal, for web cache validation
Vary: Origin	//This basically means don't cache the response
Vary: X-Origin	//This is just another part of the vary: origin, I think
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8		//The content type (an application and json, in this case), and the character set is utf-8 (so Unicode)
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff	//A security feature to prevent sniffing away responses on some web browsers
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN	//Another security feature so a page can only be displayed in a frame from the same place as the page itself
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block	//Enables a cross site scripting filter, if it is not already already enabled
Content-Length: 28656		//The length of the content is the size of the body, in decimal number of octets
Server: GSE		//Generic Stream Encapsulation, a protocol for carrying packets
Alternate-Protocol: 443:quic,p=0.02		//An alternate protocol, although I don't know what the numbers mean


//Below is a dump from what books were returned. I don't know if this is needed or not, but here it is anyway
