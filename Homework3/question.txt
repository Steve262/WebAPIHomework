Answer the following question:
â€“ Basic Authorization is easily handled in the main flow, without the need for an
additional proxy. Give one reason (there are many) OAuth tokens should not be
granted in the main flow, assuming the user has sent in the correct credentials.

One reason is security. OAuth tokens shouldn't be granted in the main flow because 
then they could be seen in the flow, and thus have a chance of being used where not 
intended. Anyone could get access to the OAuth tokens, which makes it unsecure and 
thus making OAuth security worthless. OAuth should be in a separate flow.
