This is how to use my homework:

First, put the link here in Postman (or SOAPUI or whatever): http://steve262-test.apigee.net/myhw3

Then put /oauth or /basic after it and use tokens (for oauth) and stuff to get it to work (see My Postman collection that is in another file in this repository. I like Postman way better than SOAPUI, and Shawn said we can use it.)
It should then do what it's supposed to, with calls to Github.

I worked on this assignment for a long time, and tried doing it about four different ways, and this is the only one that worked. Hopefully you can get it to work too.

Look at my question we were supposed to answer, in another file on this repository. 

If you have any questions or need any additional things, just send me an email. I might send a lot of this info in my email for this assignment as well, plus maybe some screen shots. Thanks!
